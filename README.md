Generation of a Large-scale Polymer Library Using Rule-Based Polymerization Reactions for Polymer Informatics.

All generation results and small compounds datasets can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/12585902

The generation codes for vitrimer, epoxy,polybenzimidazole (PBI), and copolymer poly(imide-imine) (PI-PIM), along with a small-scale example dataset (due to GitHub's file size limitations), can be found in the Generation folder. For generating large-scale hypothetical datasets, please use the extensive small molecule dataset provided at https://zenodo.org/records/12585902.
